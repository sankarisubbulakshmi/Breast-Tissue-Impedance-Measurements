# Breast Tissue Dataset
## Overview
The Breast Tissue Dataset provides information about various attributes measured from breast tissue samples. 
It includes features such as I0, PA500, HFS, DA, Area, A.DA, Max.IP, DR, and P, which are used to characterize different types of breast tissue.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

1. I0: Impedivity (ohm) at zero frequency
2. PA500: Phase angle at 500 KHz
3. HFS: High-frequency slope of phase angle
4. DA: Impedance distance between spectral ends
5. AREA: Area under spectrum
6. A/DA: Area normalized by DA
7. MAX IP: Maximum of the spectrumDR: Distance between I0 and real part of the maximum frequency point
8. P: Length of the spectral curve
9. Class: Tissue type (carcinoma, fibro-adenoma, mastopathy, glandular, connective, adipose)

## Learning Outcomes
Supervised Learning: In this context, the dataset includes a clear target variable (Class column) that denotes the type of breast tissue (Carcinoma, Fibro-adenoma, Mastopathy, Glandular, Connective, Adipose). 
The goal of supervised learning with this dataset would be to predict or classify the type of breast tissue based on the values of other attributes (I0, PA500, HFS, etc.).

Target Variable: The Class column provides labeled data, which is essential for training supervised learning models.
